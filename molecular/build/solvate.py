# TODO use this as a function to put pre-equilibrated water around a system

Logic would be:
1. Center solute at origin
2. Place pre-equilibrated water around the solute, taking out any water within certain distance from solution
3. Set a warning for trapped water?
4. Does the initial configuration of the water box impact the final results?
